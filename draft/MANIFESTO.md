# 1. THE HERO SECTION
hero:
  title_start: "The Manifesto for"
  title_highlight: "Agentic Automation"
  subtitle: "Governing the Shift from Automation to Autonomy. The standard for Autonomous Workflows."

# 2. THE PRINCIPLES (This generates the fancy cards)
principles:
  - title: "The Principle of Separation"
    axiom: "Reasoning must be separate from action."
    description: "Intent must be decoupled from Execution. An agent must never be granted the authority to 'think and act' in a single, opaque atomic step. Just as Terraform separated Plan from Apply, Agentic workflows must separate Reasoning from Action."

  - title: "The Principle of Provenance"
    axiom: "Every output must carry its creation story."
    description: "Output without history is contraband. In a probabilistic workflow, the final artifact is meaningless without the context of its creation. We require a cryptographic link between the agent's identity, the input context, the model used, and the final output."

  - title: "The Principle of External Sovereignty"
    axiom: "No agent can be its own authority."
    description: "Safety guardrails must exist outside the agent's cognitive loop. We cannot rely on an LLM to 'promise' it checked for security. Policy must be deterministic code, executed by a neutral orchestrator."

  - title: "The Principle of Immutable Evidence"
    axiom: "Logs must be proofs, not just text."
    description: "In the event of failure, a simple text log is insufficient. Autonomous systems require a chain of custody that is mathematically non-repudiable. Every decision and state change must be signed and sealed."

  - title: "The Principle of Ephemeral Identity"
    axiom: "Static keys are a failure of architecture."
    description: "Autonomous agents are transient processes. They should not hold long-lived credentials. Identity must be ephemeral, issued only for the duration of a specific task, and cryptographically bound to the workload."

<!-- 3. THE PREAMBLE (Standard Markdown) -->
We are standing at the edge of the Probabilistic Era.

For the last twenty years, professional automation was built on the foundation of **Determinism**. In Infrastructure, we used Ansible and Terraform. In Finance, we built rigid algorithms. If a system broke, it was a bug in the logic. The liability was static.

### The Shift

Today, we are handing control to systems that do not follow instructions, they interpret intent.

**AI Agents are not scripts.** They are probabilistic operators. They reason, plan, and execute. While this promises exponential velocity, it introduces a new, existential risk: _Stochastic Liability_.

To build a future where autonomous agents can be trusted with critical systems, we adhere to the following principles:
