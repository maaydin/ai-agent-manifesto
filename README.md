### From Automation to Autonomy.

We are witnessing a fundamental shift in software engineering: moving from deterministic tools (Terraform, Ansible) to probabilistic agents (LLMs, Autonomous Workers).

This shift can help us to deliver much faster, but it also brings new risks. Without clear rules for trust, identity, and control, we cannot safely use these agents in mission-critical systems.

**This manifesto defines the principles required to trust the machines.**

## [Read The Manifesto (v1)](v1/MANIFESTO.md)

This document explains the basic rules for using AI agents safely. It focuses on keeping thinking and actions separate, making every result traceable and verified, and ensuring that clear external rules guide what agents can do.

## 🚀 Join the Movement

We believe that the move from "Automation" to "Autonomy" requires a fundamental shift in how we architect trust. We commit to building and using systems that prioritize **Verification over Vibes** and **Safety over Speed.**

## 🛠 Reference Implementation

The principles in this manifesto are not theoretical. They require infrastructure.

We built **[Cabin Crew](https://cabincrew.dev)** as the reference implementation of this protocol. It creates the **Universal Chain of Custody** for any AI agent, on any platform.

Whether you are migrating from Ansible or building the next financial AI, Cabin Crew enforces these principles by acting as the Passport Office and Border Control for your autonomous workforce.
